# Best-Buy_Buy-Bot
This is the first revision of my Best Buy bot.
***How It Works***
This bot uses selenium web driver and beutiful soup to navigate the Best Buy website and buy products. 

# Required downloads
This bot uses python3, firefox, along with several python libraries. 

Firefox can be downloaded from here: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/

Python3 can be downloaded from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/


To install the python libraries, the following commands can be used: 
- pip install BS4
- pip install selenium 
- pip install webdriver-manager


# Modifying Bot Settings
All important settings can be modified in the Buy-Bot code. For the bot to sucesfully complete an order, you must fill in every setting.

# Running The Bot
To run the bot when in the same directory as the python script, use the following command.

If everything worked, a best buy window looking like this should appear in a firefox browser.
